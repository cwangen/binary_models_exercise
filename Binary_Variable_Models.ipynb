    "# Note\n",
    "Thank you for taking the time to read my notebook! I write rather casually throughout this, I would be more particular with my language and code, if expected. In addition, throughout this notebook I mention additional things to consider or possibly do, but don't do them here. This was a brief example of logistic regression and random forest I was asked to do, so the process was not particularly thorough as it was time limited.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Intro to project and data\n",
    "\n",
    "I was asked to create a logistic regression model and a second model (for sake of time, I did a quick random forest.) \n",
    "\n",
    "`Modeling Dataset.csv`, which contains 30,000 customers and 53 columns. The only information on the columns is as follows:\n",
    "- `target` is the dependent variable\n",
    "- `record` is the unique ID for each row\n",
    "- `benchmark` is a generic score for comparison, not to be used as model input\n",
    "- 50 unlabelled features start with `Var_` (no definition provided)\n",
    "\n",
    "There is also a data dictionary that gives acceptable values/ranges for the variables, including `Special Values` that are not fully described.\n",

    "# Quick Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data cleaning and variable creation\n",
    "   - The only missing values were in categorical variables, so they were given their own categorical value (\"Missing\").\n",
    "   - No out of bounds values greater than zero, and all negative values were assumed to be special values, even if out of bounds. \n",
    "   - Special values were assumed to be one category per variable. Additional dummy variables with special (1) or not special (0) were created.\n",
    "   - I considered and tested removal of features with minimal variance, but ultimately left them in.\n",
    "   - A stratified test/train set were created. \n",
    "   - **Further things to consider if spending more time:** Ranges of variables, what are special variables, would any variables be dropped based on analysis or what the variable is. Also other sorts of sampling options for imbalanced data (oversampling, undersampling, SMOTE, etc.)\n",
    "   \n",
    "## Logistic Regression\n",
    "   - L2 penalty was used.\n",
    "   - Checked balanced weighting of classes for imbalanced sample, as well as grid search for weights.\n",
    "   - Confusion matrix and Brier score for both, neither is perfect, so final choice seems dependent on project interest.\n",
    "   - **Further things to consider if spending more time:** There are a vareity of ways to perform variable selection in logistic regression (forward selection, backward selection, other penalties, RFE...) and I simply used one here. More time could be spent exploring variables. More tuning of weights, particularly with more knowledge about what the model actually is.\n",
    "   \n",
    "## Random Forest\n",
    "   - Picked random forest as second model, considered possible models and features.\n",
    "   - Confusion matrix and Brier score for test data.\n",
    "   - **Further things to consider if spending more time:** More tuning. Ideally with more time I might do a lot more exploration on what model is best, but I just picked random forest, and it wasn't a great model for this data.\n",
    "   \n",
    "## Comparison to benchmark and eachother\n",
    "   - I cant tell quite what the benchmark is - we're asked to give percentages between 0 and 100, but they're between 0 and 1000. I'm assuming that 0 is zero, 1 is 100, and and other number should be divided by 10.\n",
    "   - With that assumption, the benchmark is *really* overestimating the number of target values equal to 1. So while the logistic regression model isn't perfect, it is an improvement.\n",
    "   - **Further things to consider if spending more time:** I haven't checked the quality of the benchmark, to be honest. So regardless of comparison, I don't know if that makes my models good."

    "Ah, the benchmark is quite bad! Now that I've finally looked at the confusion matrix, I see that it is *vastly* overpredicting 1 values. It correspondingly *does* catch more of them than my logistic regression model, but at the cost of predicting them much more often than they actually occur. So overall, my model isn't so bad. I think it really depends on what the goals of the model are, and what we want to do. I also acknowledge the total failings of my second model, which should be totally redone or scrapped for a better process."
